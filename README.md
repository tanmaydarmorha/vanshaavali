# Vanshaavali Graph Database with Neo4j

This project sets up a graph database using Neo4j to represent a vanshaavali. It allows for easy exploration and analysis of complex family relationships using a graph structure. This approach leverages Neo4j's graph capabilities, making it efficient to query relationships, such as ancestry and familial connections across generations.

## Technologies Used

- **Neo4j**: A leading graph database designed for connected data, which provides optimal storage and querying capabilities for graph structures.
- **Docker**: Simplifies setting up Neo4j in a containerized environment, ensuring consistency across different development environments.
- **APOC Library**: A powerful plugin for Neo4j that adds advanced graph algorithms, data import/export tools, and utilities.database more accessible.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── neo4j_exports/            # Exported files (cypher scripts) will be accessible here
├── docker-compose.yml        # Docker Compose file to set up the Neo4j server
├── README.md                 # Project documentation
└── seed-data.cypher               # Cypher script for seeding initial data
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on your machine.

### 3. Run Neo4j in Docker

The Neo4j instance is configured to include the APOC plugin for exporting and importing graph data.

1. **Start the Neo4j container**:

   ```bash
   docker run --name neo4j-family-tree -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
     -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password \
     -e NEO4JLABS_PLUGINS='["apoc"]' \
     -e NEO4J_dbms_security_procedures_unrestricted=apoc.* \
     -e NEO4J_apoc_export_file_enabled=true \
     -v $(pwd)/neo4j_exports:/var/lib/neo4j/import \
     neo4j:latest
   ```

   Replace `password` with a secure password of your choice. This command:
   - Exposes the Neo4j Browser on [localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474).
   - Allows access to the Neo4j Bolt protocol on port 7687.
   - Mounts `neo4j_exports` as the `import` directory inside the Neo4j container for easy access to exported files.

2. **Verify APOC Installation** (optional):
   - Go to the Neo4j Browser at [http://localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474).
   - Run `CALL apoc.help("export");` to ensure that APOC functions are accessible.

### 4. Seed the Database

You can load initial data from `seed.cypher` using the Neo4j Browser or the `cypher-shell`:

1. **Neo4j Browser**: Copy and paste the contents of `seed-data.cypher` and run it in the query panel.
   
2. **Cypher Shell**:
   ```bash
   cypher-shell -u neo4j -p password -f seed-data.cypher
   ```

### 5. Exporting and Importing Data (optional)

To export data as a `.cypher` script using APOC, open Neo4j Browser and run:

```cypher
CALL apoc.export.cypher.all("/var/lib/neo4j/import/exportedData.cypher", {useOptimizations: {type: "UNWIND_BATCH", unwindBatchSize: 20}});
```

The exported file will be located in the `neo4j_exports` directory.

## Future Plans

1. **User Interface**: Add a UI to visualize vanshaavali data using a JavaScript graph visualization library.
2. **API Integration**: Develop APIs to interact with the Neo4j database, making it easy to update and retrieve family data programmatically.
